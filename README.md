## Doc 14 – National Trust List (NTL) Publication

**Purpose:** Hold the ETSI TS 119 612-compliant datasheet and supporting materials required for publication on the Greek NTL.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/14_NTL_Publication_Datasheet.md` – Authoritative editable datasheet (with CSV export under `Drafts/14_NTL_Publication_Datasheet`).
- `Drafts/NTL_Publication.md` – Supporting notes/guidance.
- `Final/14_NTL_Publication_Datasheet.pdf` – Submission-ready output (hash/validation pending).
- `Compliance/14_Submission_Readiness.md` – Readiness tracker (to be merged with verification checklist).
- `Compliance/QA_NTL_Log.md` – Newly created QA/evidence tracker (instead of narrative summaries).
- `Evidence/14_NTL_Submission_Packaging_Guide_GR_EN.md` – Packaging/ASiC instructions.
- `Evidence/14_NTL_Verification_Checklist.md` – Detailed verification checks.
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Validation scaffolding (to add).
- `Archive/ENRICHMENT_SUMMARY.md` – Legacy improvement narrative.

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Validate the final PDF (and Excel/ASiC output), capture SHA-256 hash, and log results in `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` + Doc 12.
2. Complete the QA log with change tickets, placeholder status, and packaging evidence.
3. Ensure `%` placeholders (service data, URLs, certificate fingerprints) are updated before submission.
