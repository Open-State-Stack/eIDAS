# Incident / BCP Evidence Placeholder

Store tangible artefacts that prove the IRP/BCP controls run as described:
- Signed incident reports (PDF) exported from `07b_Incident_Forms_GR.md`.
- First-hour checklist outputs + contact sync logs.
- RCA packages (filled `07d_RCA_Report_Template.md` + annexes) and tabletop minutes.
- Hash manifests for the `Final/Incident/` PDFs and any regulator submissions.
