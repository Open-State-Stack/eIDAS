# Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery Drafts

Use this space for:
- BCP/DR plan narrative (GR/EN) covering RTO/RPO targets, alternate sites, and dependency mapping to Doc 09.
- Tabletop or live exercise scripts referencing the same contacts as the IR plan.
- Playbooks for power/network outages, HSM failures, and RA/TSA service degradation.

Once approved, export the bilingual PDFs to `Final/Incident/` (or a dedicated `Final/BCP/` if needed) and reference their hashes in Annex B alongside the incident artefacts.
