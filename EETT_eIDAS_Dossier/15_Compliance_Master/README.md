## Doc 15 – Compliance Master Register

**Purpose:** Centralize the master compliance register, cross-reference matrix, readiness tracking, and evidence logs for all regulatory controls.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/15_Cross_References.md` – Working mapping between requirements and dossier documents.
- `Compliance/15_Submission_Readiness.md` – Status tracker (to be expanded) for Doc 15.
- `Compliance/QA_Compliance_Log.md` – New consolidated QA/evidence log (replaces placeholder).
- `Evidence/15_Master_Compliance_Register.xlsx` – Authoritative register workbook.
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Hash and validation records for the workbook.
- `Archive/` – Space for legacy exports if needed.

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Document the register structure, version, and approval history in the QA log.
2. Generate SHA-256 hash of `15_Master_Compliance_Register.xlsx` after final updates and record it in `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt`.
3. Update readiness tracker with owners/dates and link to register tabs.
