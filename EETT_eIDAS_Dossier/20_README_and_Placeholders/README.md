## Doc 20 – README & Placeholder Management

**Purpose:** Provide the central placeholder replacement guides, tables, and readiness tracking for the entire dossier.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/README_and_Placeholders.md` – Working index of placeholder rules/README content.
- `Drafts/PLACEHOLDER_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE*.md` – Detailed instructions for replacing placeholders.
- `Compliance/20_Submission_Readiness.md` – Readiness tracker for placeholder completion.
- `Compliance/QA_Placeholder_Log.md` – Consolidated QA/evidence log (new).
- `Evidence/20_README_and_Placeholder_Table.zip` – Master placeholder table (Excel/CSV zipped).
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Validation logs for the placeholder table / README exports (new).

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Update the guide and README to reflect the latest placeholders and responsible teams.
2. Validate the placeholder table ZIP (hash + Doc 12 reference) after final updates.
3. Keep readiness tracker/QA log aligned so packaging teams know when all placeholders are resolved.
