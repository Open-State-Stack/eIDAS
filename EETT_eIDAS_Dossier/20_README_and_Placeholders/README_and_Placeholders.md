## README & Placeholder Management

This folder centralises global instructions for maintaining the dossier structure and replacing placeholders before submission.

### Key Assets
- `README.md` (root) – Quick-start guide + dossier structure; now reflects current folder names (e.g., 08_User_Notifications, 09_Service_Termination, 12_Recordkeeping, 16_Submission_Packaging).
- `PLACEHOLDER_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md` & `_ROOT.md` – Master table of every `[PLACEHOLDER]` field across Docs 01–20, bilingual identifiers, and recommended replacement sources (CRM, CAB, legal database).
- `20_README_and_Placeholder_Table.zip` – Portable package (Markdown + CSV + instructions) for distribution to project teams.

### Usage Workflow
1. **Before customization:** Hand the ZIP and guides to each workstream lead so they can replace placeholders in their respective docs.
2. **After customization:** Run a repository-wide search for `[PLACEHOLDER` to confirm zero occurrences; document proof in Doc 16 (submission checklist).
3. **README updates:** Anytime a folder is renamed or new readiness artifacts are added (e.g., Doc 08/12/16 changes), update the root README to keep the dossier index accurate.
4. **Placeholder logs:** For sections under construction (e.g., Compliance Master XLSX, Submission Packaging scripts), maintain placeholder text files (`15_..._PLACEHOLDER.txt`, `16_..._PLACEHOLDER.txt`) explaining status and next actions.

### Outstanding
- Verify that future readiness or placeholder files (e.g., new automation scripts) are included here and referenced in the guides.
