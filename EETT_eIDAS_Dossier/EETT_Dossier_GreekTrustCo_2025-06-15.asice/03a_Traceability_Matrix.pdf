Important
- This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
- It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
- Replace this file with the official Traceability Matrix PDF (or export to PDF from your master spreadsheet) before packaging and submission.

Purpose
This Traceability Matrix maps every applicable requirement from the eIDAS/ETSI framework and related RFCs to GreekTrustCo’s evidence set, test/observation results, and dossier references. It enables EETT and the Conformity Assessment Body to verify that all obligations are met and that evidence is complete, current, and consistent.

Completion Guidance
1) Enumerate all applicable clauses from the standards in scope.
2) For each clause, provide a clear Requirement_Summary and the exact Evidence_Reference.
3) Use the precise Dossier_File name from the ASiC-E container root or subfolders.
4) Indicate Test_Observation_ID where control testing or auditor observation is available.
5) Mark Result as Pass/Fail/N/A; add Notes for scope limitations or compensating controls.
6) For any Fail/Gap, assign Owner, Risk_Rating, and Remediation_Due.
7) Keep pagination/section references accurate; update if source documents change.
8) Revalidate the matrix after any document version updates or policy changes.

Acceptance Criteria (for final PDF)
- Completeness: All applicable clauses mapped; no unaddressed requirements.
- Accuracy: File names, sections/pages, and IDs match the dossier exactly.
- Consistency: Results align with CAR conclusions and test evidence.
- Currency: Reflects the submission state (versions/dates current as of packaging).
- Clarity: Notes sufficiently explain decisions and any N/A scoping.
