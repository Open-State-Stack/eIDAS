PLACEHOLDER – to be replaced with official document
# Root_CA_Certificate.pem
# This is a placeholder file. Replace with the official ROOT CA X.509 certificate in PEM format.
#
# Expected format (exactly one certificate block):
# -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
# <base64-encoded DER certificate>
# -----END CERTIFICATE-----
#
# Role and scope:
# - This certificate is the TRUST ANCHOR for the test chain contained in 06_Test_Certificates.
# - Subject and Issuer are typically identical (self-signed).
# - It must be the top-most CA in the chain for all provided sample artifacts (QES/QSeal/TSA/OCSP/CRL).
#
# Minimum technical requirements (recommendations for test bundle consistency):
# - Signature algorithm: SHA-256 with RSA/ECDSA (e.g., sha256WithRSAEncryption)
# - Key usage: keyCertSign, cRLSign (critical)
# - BasicConstraints: CA:TRUE, pathlen >= 1 (or omitted for unlimited)
# - Subject Key Identifier (SKI) present
# - Authority Key Identifier (AKI) may match SKI (self-signed)
# - Reasonable validity period that comfortably covers all sample artifacts
# - If NameConstraints are set, ensure intermediates and end-entities conform
#
# Submission guidance:
# - Ensure this root CA cert is consistent with:
#   * Issuing_CA_QES_Certificate.pem
#   * Issuing_CA_QSeal_Certificate.pem
#   * TSA_CA_Certificate.pem
#   * Sample_QES_Certificate.pem
#   * Sample_OCSP_Response.der
#   * Sample_CRL.crl
# - Do NOT include private keys. Public certificate only.
# - PEM must be ASCII; no extra characters before/after the BEGIN/END lines.
#
# Quick local verification tips (example commands):
#   openssl x509 -in Root_CA_Certificate.pem -noout -text
#   openssl x509 -in Root_CA_Certificate.pem -noout -subject -issuer -fingerprint -sha256
#   # (Expected) subject == issuer (self-signed root)
#
# Chain checking (example, adjust file names as needed):
#   cat Issuing_CA_QES_Certificate.pem Root_CA_Certificate.pem > chain_qes.pem
#   openssl verify -CAfile Root_CA_Certificate.pem -untrusted Issuing_CA_QES_Certificate.pem Sample_QES_Certificate.pem
#
# Compliance note:
# - This placeholder must be replaced before final packaging/signing of the ASiC-E container.
# - Do not submit the dossier with this placeholder present.
