PLACEHOLDER – to be replaced with official document
# TSA_CA_Certificate.pem
# This is a placeholder file. Replace with the official TSA CA X.509 certificate in PEM format.
# Expected format:
# -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
# <base64-encoded DER certificate>
# -----END CERTIFICATE-----
#
# Guidance:
# - This certificate should be the issuing CA (not end-entity) for the Time-Stamping Authority (TSA).
# - Must be PEM-encoded, ASCII, and include exactly one certificate block.
# - Recommended key usage: keyCertSign, cRLSign; Extended Key Usage: timeStamping (as applicable).
# - Ensure the certificate chain is consistent with other test artifacts in 06_Test_Certificates.
# - Do not submit the dossier with this placeholder.
