Submission Notes
- Replace all placeholder files in 06_Test_Certificates with the official artifacts.
- Ensure certificate chains are coherent: Root → Issuing → End-entity.
- Ensure AIA/CRL/OCSP endpoints are reachable or clearly marked as test.
- Hash algorithm baseline: SHA-256 minimum.
- Do not submit the dossier with this placeholder guide.

End of placeholder.
