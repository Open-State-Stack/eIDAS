PLACEHOLDER – to be replaced with official document

File: 18_Gantt_Chart_Project_Timeline.pdf
Container: EETT_Dossier_GreekTrustCo_2025-06-15.asice (root level)

Description
This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension. It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
Replace this file with the official “Gantt Chart – Project Timeline” PDF (exported from your planning tool) prior to packaging and submission.

Purpose
Provide a single, consolidated, time-phased view of all activities, dependencies, owners, and milestones leading to the submission of the EETT dossier and the commencement of Qualified Trust Services. The chart must clearly present the critical path to the target submission date (2025-06-15) and post-submission activities.

Recommended Export Properties (for the official PDF)
- Orientation and size: Landscape; A3 preferred (or A4 with legible scale)
- Timescale: Weeks along the top, months/quarters labeled
- Fonts/colors: High contrast; color-blind friendly palette
- Legend: Included (workstreams, status colors, milestone markers)
- Pagination: Single page if possible; if multi-page, include overlap and page numbers
- File format: PDF (non-password-protected; PDF/A recommended)

Planning Model (use in your PM tool; reflect in the Gantt)
- Columns (minimum): WBS, Task ID, Task Name, Owner, Start, Finish, Duration, Predecessors, Deliverable, Sign-off, Status, % Complete, Notes
- Status Color Key: Not Started (gray), In Progress (blue), At Risk (amber), Blocked (red), Complete (green)
- Milestones: Black diamond markers; zero-duration tasks
- Dependencies: Finish-to-Start (FS) by default; show Start-to-Start (SS) where parallelization is intentional
- Baseline: Freeze a “Submission Baseline” and track variance
- Calendars: Define working days, holidays, and blackout periods (e.g., change freeze)
