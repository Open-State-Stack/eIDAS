  Supporting_Docs/Certifications/HSM_FIPS_Certification.pdf

Important
  - This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
  - It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
  - Replace with the official FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 certification evidence package for all Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) used in Qualified Trust Services before packaging and submission.

Purpose
  Provide authoritative evidence that the cryptographic modules (HSMs) used by GreekTrustCo for PKI/CA key generation, key protection, certificate issuance, OCSP signing, CRL signing, and TSA signing are validated under the U.S. NIST CMVP (Cryptographic Module Validation Program) at an appropriate FIPS 140 level (typically Level 3 or higher), and that the exact module name, firmware version, operational environment, and security policy in use match the validated configuration.

Acceptable Evidence (one or more of the following, depending on vendor/module)
  - NIST CMVP FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 Certificate PDF(s) showing:
    • Certificate number
    • Module name and version
    • Vendor name
    • Validation level (overall and per area where applicable)
    • Operating environment(s) covered (if applicable)
  - NIST CMVP listing page(s) captured as PDF for the module certificate(s)
  - Non-Proprietary Security Policy PDF(s) from CMVP for the exact module and version in use
  - Vendor attestation letter confirming the deployed hardware/firmware and configuration are within the validated boundary
  - Algorithm validation summaries (CAVP/ACVP) for relevant algorithms (AES, SHA-2/3, RSA, ECDSA, DRBG, KDF, etc.) associated with the module certificate
  - For multi-module deployments (production and DR), evidence for each distinct module model/firmware

Required Properties of the Official Document
  - Format: PDF (non-password-protected; printable; PDF/A acceptable)
  - Language: English (vendor/CMVP) or bilingual packaging acceptable
  - Coverage:
    • All HSMs used for Root CA (if applicable), Issuing CA(s), OCSP/CRL signing, TSA signing
    • Exact module/firmware versions and configurations matching production and DR
  - Validation:
    • FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ or FIPS 140-3 Level 3+ for cryptographic modules handling TSP private keys
    • Certificate(s) must be in “Active/Validated” or “Historical” only if still within your policy acceptance window and consistent with current regulatory guidance; avoid “Revoked/Not Validated”
  - Traceability:
    • Clear mapping from each HSM serial/model/firmware in use to a specific CMVP certificate number and Security Policy
    • If multiple modes are supported by the module, indicate the mode configured (e.g., Approved mode)

Minimum Expected Contents
  1) Executive Summary (one page)
     - Statement that all HSMs used for Qualified Trust Services operate within CMVP-validated boundaries at Level 3+ (FIPS 140-2 or 140-3)
     - List of services relying on HSMs: Root/Issuing CA, OCSP/CRL, TSA
     - Table of modules with certificate numbers and validation levels
  2) Module Inventory and Mapping
     - For each environment (Production, DR):
       • Service role: Root CA / Issuing CA / OCSP / CRL / TSA
       • Vendor & Model (e.g., Thales Luna, Entrust nShield, Utimaco Se, etc.)
       • Hardware model/part number
       • Firmware version (exact)
       • FIPS certificate number and level
       • Operating mode (Approved mode confirmation)
       • Serial numbers or asset IDs (can be redacted if sensitive; retain unredacted internally)
  3) Certificates and Security Policies (Appendices)
     - CMVP Certificate PDF(s) per module
     - Non-Proprietary Security Policy PDF(s) per module and exact version
     - Links or references to CMVP listing pages (include date of retrieval)
  4) Algorithm Validations (CAVP/ACVP)
     - Summary table of validated algorithms for the module certificate(s)
     - References to NIST algorithm validation entries (hash/signature of export or URLs)
  5) Configuration and Boundary Statement
     - Confirmation that deployed configuration matches the Security Policy requirements:
       • Physical security (tamper evidence, tamper response)
       • Roles, services, and authentication (M of N, dual control)
       • Approved algorithms only (disable non-approved where applicable)
       • Key management functions in Approved mode
     - Any excluded interfaces or disabled features (if required by Security Policy)
  6) Change Management and Monitoring
     - Policy/procedure reference for:
       • Firmware updates (approval, testing, rollback, revalidation)
       • Periodic verification of Approved mode and module status
       • Handling of vendor notices, CMVP status updates, or certificate transitions (e.g., 140-2 to 140-3)
  7) Exceptions and Transitions (if applicable)
     - If any component is in historical status (140-2) with a planned transition:
       • Risk assessment summary and compensating controls
       • Target completion date for transition to 140-3
  8) Sign-off
     - Authorized signatory attestation that the evidence is complete and accurate as of submission date

Verification and Consistency Checks (Internal)
  - Match every HSM in production/DR to a CMVP certificate number and Security Policy version
  - Confirm Approved mode operation (evidence: configuration printouts/screenshots retained internally)
  - Validate that firmware versions exactly match those listed in the certificate or security policy
  - Ensure all cryptographic operations for private keys used in Qualified Trust Services occur inside the validated boundary
  - Review algorithm sets against TSPS/Profiles Guide to ensure only approved algorithms are used
  - Check CMVP status pages shortly before submission to confirm certificate status is still valid
  - Align key ceremony documentation with Security Policy requirements (roles, dual control, zeroization, sealing)
