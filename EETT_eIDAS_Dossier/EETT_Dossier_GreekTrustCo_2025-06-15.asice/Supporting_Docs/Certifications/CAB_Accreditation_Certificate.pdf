PLACEHOLDER – to be replaced with official document

File
  Supporting_Docs/Certifications/CAB_Accreditation_Certificate.pdf

Important
  - This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
  - It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
  - Replace with the official, current Accreditation Certificate (and any scope annex) for the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) that issued the Conformity Assessment Report (CAR) before packaging and submission.

Purpose
  Provide authoritative evidence that the Conformity Assessment Body (e.g., TÜV or other CAB) that assessed GreekTrustCo’s Qualified Trust Services is formally accredited for the applicable eIDAS/ETSI scheme. This supports EETT’s requirement that CARs are issued by appropriately accredited CABs.

Acceptable Evidence (one or more as applicable)
  - Accreditation Certificate for the CAB issued by a National Accreditation Body (NAB) that is a signatory to EA MLA/IAF MLA.
  - Scope Annex explicitly listing the accreditation scope referencing eIDAS/ETSI trust service provider assessments (ETSI EN 319 403 scheme).
  - Public directory printout (PDF) from the NAB showing the CAB’s current accreditation status and scope (including validity dates).
  - Cover letter from the CAB (optional) cross-referencing the accreditation certificate/ID and confirming applicability to the CAR.

Required Properties of the Official Document
  - Format: PDF (non-password-protected; printable; PDF/A acceptable)
  - Language: Greek and/or English (as issued by the NAB/CAB)
  - Issuer: National Accreditation Body (e.g., ESYD in Greece) or equivalent recognized Accreditation Body
  - Accreditation Framework (indicative; use what is actually on the certificate):
      • ETSI EN 319 403 scheme (Conformity assessment requirements for bodies auditing and certifying Trust Service Providers)
      • Underlying accreditation standards (as defined by the scheme and NAB), often ISO/IEC 17065 or ISO/IEC 17021-1 as applicable to the scheme owner’s rules
  - Validity: Certificate issue and expiry dates clearly stated; status must be “active/valid” on the NAB directory as of submission
  - Scope: Scope text must cover conformity assessment of trust service providers under eIDAS/ETSI; list any relevant service categories (QES, QSeal, TSA, QWAC) or generic “Trust Services” scope per scheme

Minimum Expected Contents
  1) Accreditation Body Information
     - NAB legal name, logo, and contact details
     - EA/IAF MLA signatory indication (logos or statement)
     - Accreditation certificate number/ID
  2) Accredited CAB Information
     - CAB legal name and address
     - CAB contact details (optional)
     - Reference to the accredited certification/assessment scheme for trust services (ETSI EN 319 403)
  3) Accreditation Scope
     - Clear wording that includes “Trust Service Providers under eIDAS” and/or “ETSI EN 319 403”
     - If scope is enumerated by standards/services, ensure the TSP trust services are included (QES, QSeal, TSA, QWAC where applicable)
  4) Validity and Status
     - Issue date and expiry/next surveillance date
     - Conditions or limitations (if any)
     - Link/QR to the NAB public directory entry for ongoing verification
  5) Signatures and Seals
     - Authorized signatory of the NAB; date of issuance
  6) Scope Annex (if separate)
     - Detailed scope list and codes; sites/locations (if applicable)
     - Any notes regarding the conformity assessment scheme versions

Verification and Consistency Checks (Internal)
  - Confirm the CAB named in the CAR (03_Conformity_Assessment_Report_TUV_2025.pdf) matches the CAB on the accreditation certificate.
  - Verify the accreditation on the NAB’s public register (URL/QR) and capture the verification date (retain internal evidence).
  - Ensure the accreditation scope explicitly covers ETSI EN 319 403 scheme for TSP assessments (or the scheme identifier used by the NAB for eIDAS trust services).
  - Check that the accreditation status is “valid/active” as of submission date (2025-06-15).
  - If services are limited by scope, ensure the scope covers all qualified services included in the CAR (QES/QSeal/TSA/QWAC as applicable).
