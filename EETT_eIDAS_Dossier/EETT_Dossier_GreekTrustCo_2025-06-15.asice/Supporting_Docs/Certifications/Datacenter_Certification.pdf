Important
  - This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
  - It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
  - Replace with the official Datacenter Certification/Attestation package PDF(s) from your colocation/cloud provider(s) before packaging and submission.

Purpose
  Provide authoritative evidence that the datacenter(s) hosting GreekTrustCo’s critical PKI, RA, status (CRL/OCSP), and supporting infrastructure meet recognized standards for physical security, power, cooling, resilience, and operations, consistent with eIDAS/ETSI expectations.

Acceptable Evidence (one or a combination, depending on provider)
  - Uptime Institute Tier Certification (Design/Constructed Facility/Operational Sustainability) – Tier III or IV preferred for critical zones
  - EN 50600 certification or assessment report (availability classes, protection classes)
  - ANSI/TIA-942 Rated facility certification (Rated 3 or 4)
  - ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certificate covering the datacenter operator and the hosting sites used
  - ISO 22301 (Business Continuity) certificate for the datacenter operator
  - SOC 2 Type II (Security, Availability, and optionally Confidentiality) attestation report (redacted customer-available version)
  - Independent Letter of Attestation (LoA) by accredited auditor confirming physical security controls, power/cooling redundancy, access controls, monitoring, and incident handling at the specific sites used
  - Fire safety and suppression certification (e.g., EN 15004, FM-200/Novec-1230 systems) documentation where applicable

Required Properties of the Official Document
  - Format: PDF (non-password-protected; printable; PDF/A acceptable)
  - Language: Greek and/or English
  - Issuer: Recognized certification body or auditor; or the datacenter operator providing copies of valid certificates and a letter referencing the specific sites/rooms/cages used by GreekTrustCo
  - Coverage: Explicit reference to the physical locations (addresses) and rooms/cages/racks where GreekTrustCo’s equipment is installed
  - Validity: Certificates/attestations current as of submission date (2025-06-15), including issue/expiry dates or period of coverage for SOC 2 Type II
  - Verification: CB/AB directory links, Uptime/TIA-942/EN 50600 verification numbers, or auditor contact for verification

Minimum Expected Contents
  1) Datacenter Operator Identification
     - Legal name, addresses of the facilities (primary and DR) used by GreekTrustCo
     - Contact information for compliance/audit verification
  2) Facility Certifications/Attestations
     - Uptime Institute Tier (if applicable): Tier level, certification type (Design/CF/OS), certificate IDs, effective dates
     - EN 50600 class details (availability class, protection class)
     - ANSI/TIA-942 rating (Rated 3 or 4), certificate number and scope
     - ISO 27001 and ISO 22301 certificates for the operator, with scope and site annexes
     - SOC 2 Type II report (customer-available), coverage period, trust service categories in scope
     - Fire detection/suppression system certification details (e.g., clean agent type, compliance standards)
  3) Physical Security and Access Control Summary
     - Multi-factor access, mantraps, CCTV coverage/retention, guard presence and hours, visitor procedures and escort policies
     - Segregation of cages/rooms, anti-tailgating, tamper evidence procedures
  4) Power, Cooling, and Environmental Controls
     - Redundancy levels (e.g., N+1/2N), UPS/generator details, fuel autonomy, maintenance procedures
     - Cooling redundancy and environmental monitoring; hot/cold aisle containment
  5) Resilience, Monitoring, and Incident Handling
     - Monitoring systems (BMS/DCIM), alerting, incident response procedures and SLAs
     - Maintenance windows, change management, and communication processes
  6) Site-Specific Mapping to GreekTrustCo
     - Explicit mapping of GreekTrustCo cages/racks/rooms to the certified/attested scope
     - If the certification is broader than the specific rooms used, a letter stating inclusion of those rooms within scope
  7) Validity and Verification
     - Certificate IDs, issue and expiry dates (or report period for SOC 2)
     - Verification URLs/QR codes, accreditation references for CBs or auditors

Verification and Consistency Checks (Internal)
  - Confirm facility names/addresses match those in GreekTrustCo hosting contracts, diagrams, and the TSPS
  - Validate certification status online (CB directories, Uptime/TIA/EN 50600 registers, or SOC report cover letter)
  - Ensure validity dates cover the submission date and foreseeable operational window
  - Confirm redundancy claims (Tier/Rating) align with internal availability objectives and BCP/DR planning
  - Check that the specific cages/rooms/racks used by GreekTrustCo are in scope of the cited certifications/attestations
  - Align physical access procedures with RA/PKI key ceremony and operations controls
