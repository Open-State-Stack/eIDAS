Purpose
  Provide authoritative evidence of GreekTrustCo’s incorporation terms, governance structure, representation powers, and corporate rules.

  - Consolidated Articles of Association (Τελευταίο Κωδικοποιημένο Καταστατικό) including all amendments, notarized where applicable.
  - Initial Articles plus all subsequent amendments, with references to ΓΕΜΗ filings or ΦΕΚ publications.
  - ΓΕΜΗ official extracts that include references to the Articles and amendments.
  - Board/Shareholder resolutions that amend key Articles or confirm representation powers, if not yet codified.
  - Certified translation to English only if required; Greek originals should remain primary.

  - Language: Greek original. If an English translation is included, compile the Greek original first, then attach the English translation in the same PDF.
