PLACEHOLDER – to be replaced with official document

File
  Supporting_Docs/Legal/Director_IDs/QTS_Manager_ID_Card.pdf

Important
  - This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
  - It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
  - Replace with an official identity document scan suitable for regulatory due diligence before packaging and submission.

Purpose
  Provide identity evidence for the Qualified Trust Services (QTS) Manager, who is an authorized, control-critical role referenced in corporate records and operational policies. This supports regulator and auditor due diligence linking dossier approvals and responsibilities to a uniquely identified person.

Acceptable Evidence (one of the following)
  - Government-issued Greek ID card (both sides, if applicable).
  - Passport (main bio page; include machine-readable zone if required; apply permitted redactions).
  - Other government-issued photo ID accepted under applicable law and internal KYC/KYB policy.

Data visibility and privacy (minimization and redaction)
  - Keep visible (at minimum):
    • Full legal name (must match corporate records and dossier signatures)
    • Photograph
    • Document type/issuer
    • Expiry date
  - May redact (apply privacy-by-design and legal guidance):
    • Document number (partial), place of birth, personal ID numbers not required for verification
    • MRZ line segments (if not required)
    • Address or secondary personal details not needed for identity match
  - Ensure redactions do not obscure authenticity/issuer fields needed for verification.

Requirements for the official PDF
  - Single, legible PDF (color scan recommended, 300+ DPI).
  - Current and valid (not expired at submission).
  - Full legal name exactly matches entries in corporate records/authority matrix.
  - If multiple pages/sides, include all necessary sides/pages in correct order.
  - No passwords or encryption.

Cross-checks (consistency)
  - Matches names/role/signature blocks in:
    • Supporting_Docs/Legal/GEMH_Company_Registration.pdf
    • Supporting_Docs/Legal/Articles_of_Association.pdf
    • 04_TSP_Policy_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf
    • 05_TSPS_Qualified_Services_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf
    • 07a_Incident_Response_Plan_GR_EN.pdf (contacts/roles, if listed)
    • 11_Revocation_SOP_GR_EN.pdf (operational responsibilities, if listed)
    • 17_Executive_Brief_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf (leadership/roles, if referenced)
  - Aligns with internal authority matrix and appointment records for the QTS Manager.
  - If the QTS Manager is also a dossier signatory, ensure representation/authority per Articles_of_Association and ΓΕΜΗ records.

Role-specific notes
  - The QTS Manager is responsible for qualified trust service governance, compliance sign-offs, and operational oversight as per TSPS.
  - Ensure appointment/authorization evidence exists internally (e.g., HR appointment letter, board resolution) and is consistent with this identity.

Companion file (to be provided separately)
  - Supporting_Docs/Legal/Director_IDs/CEO_ID_Card.pdf
  - Provide identity document for the CEO (authorized signatory); apply the same rules above.
