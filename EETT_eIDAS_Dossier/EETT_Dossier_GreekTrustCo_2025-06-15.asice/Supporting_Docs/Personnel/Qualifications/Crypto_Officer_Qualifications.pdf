  Supporting_Docs/Personnel/Qualifications/Crypto_Officer_Qualifications.pdf

Important
  - This is a temporary placeholder saved with a .pdf extension.
  - It is plain text and NOT a valid PDF binary.
  - Replace with the official, signed Qualifications & Training Pack for the Crypto Officer(s) before packaging and submission.

Purpose
  Provide authoritative evidence that the designated Crypto Officer(s) (COs) possess the qualifications, experience, and training to operate and safeguard cryptographic modules and keys used for Qualified Trust Services (QES/QSeal/TSA and status services). This evidence supports EETT and auditor due diligence on competence for key management, HSM operations, ceremonies, and secure processes required by eIDAS and ETSI standards.

  - Language: Greek and/or English (if bilingual, place Greek first)
  - Structure: Role profile + CV(s) + training record(s) + certifications + attestations (merged into one PDF with contents page)
  - Dates: Current version, signed and dated by the Crypto Officer(s) and the QTS Manager (or Security Officer) within 90 days of submission
  - Evidence: Clear scans of credential certificates and training attestations; pages legible and complete
  - File name (exact): Crypto_Officer_Qualifications.pdf
  - Location (exact): EETT_Dossier_GreekTrustCo_2025-06-15.asice/Supporting_Docs/Personnel/Qualifications/

     - Audit/event logging, tamper-evidence, secure time, chain of custody
     - Change control and documented procedures; incident handling for key compromise
     - Regulatory/standards awareness: eIDAS, ETSI EN 319 401/411-1/411-2/421, RFC 5280/6960/3161

     - Key ceremony and PKI operations workshops
     - Security certifications (e.g., CISSP/CISM/CISA) and/or ISO 27001 implementer/auditor (if applicable)
     - eIDAS/ETSI-focused training (EN 319 401/411/412/421) – provider, content summary
     - Incident response and secure operations trainings (e.g., logging/monitoring, forensics triage basics)
     - Any cryptography fundamentals or advanced courses (as relevant to role)

  6) Practical Experience & Case Summaries
     - Key ceremonies executed/supported (scope: Root/Issuing/TSA/OCSP/CRL), with roles performed (redact sensitive details)
     - HSM cluster lifecycle: initialization, partitioning, key replication/backup/restore, firmware management
     - Algorithm migration/deprecation projects (e.g., RSA size uplift; SHA-1→SHA-256+ transitions)
     - Control testing/audit support (e.g., CAR engagements, internal audits, witness statements, corrective actions)

  7) Procedural Mastery and Evidence
     - Referenced SOPs/Work Instructions under TSPS:
       • Key generation and ceremony SOPs/checklists
       • Quorum/M-of-N administration procedure
       • Backup and restore (sealed media handling, KCV verification)
       • Zeroization and end-of-life procedures
       • Incident response for suspected key compromise
       • Firmware update/rollback and configuration hardening procedures
     - Acknowledgement statement (read/understood latest SOPs), signed by the Crypto Officer(s)

  8) Independence, Ethics, and Conflicts
     - Statement confirming independence from roles determining business purposes (per governance model)
     - Conflict-of-interest declaration and mitigation (if any)
     - Code of conduct acknowledgment (security and confidentiality obligations)

  9) On-Call/Escalation and Substitution
     - On-call or availability expectations for ceremonies/emergencies
     - Approved deputies and substitution process; required approvals for emergency actions

     - Crypto Officer(s) attestation of competency and readiness
     - Reviewer (Security Officer or QTS Manager) sign-off and date
     - Document control (version, next review date)

Privacy and Minimization
  - Redact personal data not required for competence verification (national IDs, home addresses, private phone/email).
  - Keep credential numbers that assist verification; include verification URLs/QRs where possible.
  - Avoid sensitive personal data categories unless strictly necessary for regulatory verification.

Verification and Consistency Checks (Internal)
  - Skillset and training align with TSPS responsibilities (05_TSPS_Qualified_Services_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf)
  - HSM vendor certifications match the models/firmware in production and DR (see HSM_FIPS_Certification.pdf)
  - Ceremony responsibilities align with authority matrix, dual control, and split knowledge requirements
  - SOPs acknowledged are the latest approved versions; change control references are current
  - Experience and training dates are current (preferably within last 24 months for critical topics)
