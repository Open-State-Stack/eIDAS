## Doc 16 – Submission Packaging

**Purpose:** Capture the repeatable ASiC-E packaging workflow, readiness tracking, and evidence required to submit the final dossier to EETT.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/Submission_Packaging_Workflow.md` – Detailed ASiC-E + qualified signature guide (former placeholder text).
- `Drafts/Submission_Packaging.md` – Additional notes, sample commands, delivery checklists.
- `Compliance/16_Submission_Readiness.md` – Status tracker for Doc 16 (to be updated with owners/dates).
- `Compliance/QA_Packaging_Log.md` – Consolidated QA/evidence log (new).
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` – Will store hashes of final ASiC/PDF outputs.
- `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – To record packaging/signature validation steps and Doc 12 references.
- `Archive/` – Reserved for legacy artefacts when newer versions replace them.

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Update readiness tracker with specific deliverables (asice container, README_SUBMISSION, validation reports) and assign owners.
2. Record actual hash/validation data in Evidence logs once packaging is executed.
3. Store validator reports and delivery checklist outputs in Evidence when available.
