## Executive Brief – Quick Reference

**Master document:** `00_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md` (also stored at the repo root). This is the authoritative bilingual narrative covering services in scope, project milestones, and mapping every dossier folder (01–20) to its regulatory evidence.

### Snapshot
- **Services requested:** QES (natural/legal), QSeal, QTS, QVal, QPres, REM, QWAC (tick actual services directly inside the master doc).
- **Milestones:** Section “Key Milestones” in the master brief sources dates from `18_Project_Timeline`. Latest updates (as of 2025-11-14): Technical Artifacts (2025-11-25), Incident & Termination Drills (2025-12-05), CAB Conformity Audit (2025-12-15), Finalization & QA (2025-12-22), Submission to EETT (2025-12-31), Post-Submission Follow-up (2026-01-31). Update both files whenever the Gantt chart changes.
- **Compliance mapping:** Sections 1–15 enumerate each dossier component (registry app, CAR, TSPS, incident plan, etc.) with its eIDAS/EETT references and current status/outstanding actions; enhanced with detailed cross-references (e.g., Folder 03 assessments to Folder 06 tests) for improved traceability as per updates in Folder 19.

### How to Use
1. **Use `00_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md` for full detail.** This quick reference simply points to the canonical locations.
2. **Refresh statistics** (prep %, QA date, CAB audit date, submission target) before sharing with executives or EETT.
3. **Keep the document registry entries current** whenever folder names change (e.g., `05_TSPS`, `08_User_Notifications`). The master brief functions as the global index of evidence.
4. **Ensure placeholders are cleared** (company name, submission date, go-live date, service checkboxes) prior to producing the signed PDF (`17_Executive_Brief_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf`).
