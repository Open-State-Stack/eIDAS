## Doc 17 – Executive Brief

**Purpose:** Provide the bilingual executive summary (Doc 17) highlighting services in scope, milestones, and dossier cross-references for leadership and regulators.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/00_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md` – Authoritative master brief (currently empty; requires population).
- `Drafts/Executive_Brief.md` – Quick-reference overview pointing to the master brief.
- `Final/17_Executive_Brief_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf` – Signed two-page executive summary (validation pending).
- `Compliance/17_Submission_Readiness.md` – Readiness tracker for Doc 17.
- `Compliance/QA_Executive_Log.md` – GAP/evidence log (new).
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Hash + validation registers for the signed PDF (new).
- `Archive/` – Reserved for prior iterations if needed.

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Populate `Drafts/00_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md` with the full bilingual narrative and ensure all placeholders (services, dates, milestones) are resolved.
2. Validate `Final/17_Executive_Brief_GR_EN_SIGNED.pdf`, capture SHA-256 hash/signature proof, and record in Evidence logs.
3. Update readiness tracker and QA log with owners/dates so leadership knows status before submission.
