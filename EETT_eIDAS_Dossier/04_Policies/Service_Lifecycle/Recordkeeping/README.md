# Recordkeeping Policy Evidence

- `Final/12_Recordkeeping_Policy_GR_EN.pdf` → symlink to canonical dossier (Folder 12).  
- Aligns with EETT Article 12, GDPR storage limitations, and EV-402 retention logs (7-year requirement).
- Traceability: `03a_Traceability_Matrix` rows `EETT-Art12-1`, `eIDAS-24-2-g`.

Pending actions:
- Link DSAR (DOC-GDPR-DSAR-001) references when the Excel traceability matrix is populated.
- Capture hashed evidence IDs in Annex B.
