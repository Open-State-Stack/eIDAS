# Incident Response Plan Evidence

- `Final/07a_Incident_Response_Plan_GR_EN.pdf` → symlink to the master document stored in `07_Risk_And_Incidents`.
- Scope: Level 1–4 incident categorisation, 24×7 revocation workflow, Article 5 notifications (EETT).
- Traceability references: `03a_Traceability_Matrix` rows `EETT-Art5-3`, `EETT-Art5-4`, `eIDAS-19-2`.
- Cross-links: Notification templates (`08_User_Notifications`), SOC hotline `+30 210 614 5999`.

Outstanding action: ensure the signed PDF hash is captured in Annex B (Evidence Register) once the matrix is populated.
