# Governance Policies

Store the governing trust-service policies here once approved:
- Trust Service Policy (bilingual)
- Trust Service Practice Statement (bilingual)
- Certificate Policy (RFC 3647 structure)
- Certification Practice Statement (RFC 3647 structure)

Each document must include version, approval signatures, and ETSI/EETT mapping tables.

## Subfolders
- `TSP_Policy/` – working drafts (`Drafts/`), readiness logs (`Compliance/`), and the policy manifest (`README.md`). Final bilingual PDFs should be stored alongside the drafts once signed.
