- `Final/18_Gantt_Chart_Project_Timeline.pdf` – Signed/exported Gantt (validation pending).
- `Compliance/18_Submission_Readiness.md` – Readiness tracker.
- `Compliance/QA_Timeline_Log.md` – New QA/evidence log capturing updates, approvals, and hash status.
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Hash/validation registers for the final Gantt export.
