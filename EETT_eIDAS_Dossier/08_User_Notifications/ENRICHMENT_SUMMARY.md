# USER NOTIFICATION PLAN ENRICHMENT SUMMARY  
## Document 08: Σχέδιο Ειδοποίησης Χρηστών / User Notification Plan

**Analysis Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Prepared by:** Senior Compliance Officer (Regulatory Audit Team)  
**Status:** ✅ Submission-ready (pending template PDF validation)  
**Scope of Review:** `08_User_Notification_Plan_GR_EN.md`, `08_User_Notification_Plan_GR_EN_ENRICHED.md`, `08_Submission_Readiness.md`, `ENRICHMENT_SUMMARY_Doc08.md`, `User_Notifications.md`, `08_User_Notification_Templates_GR_EN.pdf`

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The User Notification Plan (Doc 08) has been fully merged and enriched. Sections 4–13 were authored, SLA tables were added, Annexes A–D were created, and bilingual templates were embedded. The plan now describes precise timing obligations, stakeholder contact governance, testing requirements, and annual reporting aligned with **eIDAS Article 19(2)**, **EETT Regulation Article 5 & 11**, **GDPR Articles 33-34**, **ETSI EN 319 401 §6.1.4**, and **CABF BR §4.9.3**.

All textual content now resides in `08_User_Notification_Plan_GR_EN.md`. The previous “ENRICHED” variant is retained only as archival reference and clearly marked as such. Supporting readiness and QA documents were re-aligned to flag remaining evidence gaps (mainly PDF template validation and contact placeholder finalization).

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS

| Area | Previous Gap | Enriched State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Structure** | Sections 4–13 missing, Annexes absent | Added timing, workflows, contact governance, testing, document control, Annexes A–D | Complete traceability to regulatory clauses |
| **Timing Requirements** | No SLA table | Bilingual SLA matrix with triggers, deadlines, citations | Demonstrates compliance with Art. 5 EETT & Art. 19(2) eIDAS |
| **Templates** | Only two examples | Six bilingual templates + references to Doc 13 | Ready-to-use communications kit |
| **Cross-Border Handling** | Generic statements | Dedicated section on translations, liaison, timezone handling | Supports ENISA/EU coordination |
| **Metrics & Testing** | Not defined | KPIs, drill schedule, evidence expectations | Enables annual effectiveness report & audits |
| **Workflow & RACI** | Not captured | Section 9 workflow + Section 8 responsibility matrix | Shows governance maturity |

## REGULATORY ALIGNMENT SNAPSHOT

| Requirement | Evidence in Doc 08 |
|-------------|-------------------|
| eIDAS Art. 19(2) – notify subscribers & relying parties | Sections 2–7 (triggers/methods), Annex C (status API) |
| EETT Art. 5 – incident reporting & timing | Section 4 SLA table; Annex A report form |
| EETT Art. 11 – revocation & termination | Section 5 templates C & D; Section 4 table |
| GDPR Arts. 33-34 – HDPA/data subject notice | Section 2.2 and Template B |
| ETSI EN 319 401 §6.1.4 – public announcements | Sections 3.3 & 6 |
| CABF BR §4.9.3 – key compromise | Template C + SLA table |

All references tie back to Doc 07 (Incident Response), Doc 11 (Revocation), Doc 12 (Recordkeeping), and Doc 13 (Communication Templates) for consistency.

## OUTSTANDING ACTIONS

1. **Template PDF validation (high):** `08_User_Notification_Templates_GR_EN.pdf` could not be text-validated within the sandbox (no PDF-to-text utility). Need manual inspection to confirm bilingual coverage, QSeal signature, and consistency with Section 5 templates.
2. **Contact placeholders (medium):** Populate `[CONTACT]`, `[PHONE]`, `[STATUS_URL]`, etc., using MASTER_CONTACT_LIST.md to maintain alignment with Docs 01 & 13.
3. **QA reference updates (medium):** Refresh `ENRICHMENT_SUMMARY_Doc08.md` and `User_Notifications.md` to cite the new version and store reviewer sign-offs.
4. **Cross-border recipient registry (medium):** Once external relying parties are confirmed, append them to Doc 13 and note translation requirements in Section 7.
