## Doc 19 – Compliance Register

**Purpose:** Host the Master Compliance Register (markdown/PDF exports + XLS workbook) and readiness tracking for system-wide compliance mapping.

### Folder Map
- `Drafts/19_Master_Compliance_Register.md` – Working Markdown register summary.
- `Drafts/Compliance_Register.md` – Additional narrative/README from earlier iterations.
- `Final/19_Master_Compliance_Register.pdf` – Rendered register for submission (validation pending).
- `Evidence/15_Master_Compliance_Register.xlsx` – Authoritative workbook (shared with Doc 15).
- `Compliance/19_Submission_Readiness.md` – Readiness tracker.
- `Compliance/QA_Register_Log.md` – QA log tracking hashes, updates, and approvals (new).
- `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt` & `Evidence/Template_Validation_Log.md` – Hash + validation records for the PDF and workbook (new).

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Finalize the Markdown summary and PDF export after ensuring workbook accuracy.
2. Validate the PDF (and workbook) by capturing hashes/signature evidence in the new logs; reference Doc 12 records.
3. Update readiness tracker and QA log with owners/dates to demonstrate control over register updates.
