# Annex – Qualified Preservation Service (Placeholder)

- Describe preservation workflows, storage formats, cryptographic mechanisms, and supervision procedures once the service is activated.
- Map controls to ETSI EN 319 411-1 §7, EN 319 422, and eIDAS Annex II (if applicable).
- Until finalized, explicitly mark the service as “not in initial scope” in §3 of the TSPS to avoid misleading regulators.
