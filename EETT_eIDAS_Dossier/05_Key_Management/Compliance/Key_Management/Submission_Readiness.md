## Action Items
1. Export the procedures/ceremony script to a bilingual PDF, apply QSeal, and store under `Final/`.
2. Upload signed ceremony packets, backup verification logs, and destruction certificates; record hashes in Annex B (EV-501..EV-510).
3. Update the traceability matrix rows (eIDAS-24-2-c, ETSI-411-1-7.4) once the Excel workbook exists, pointing to this folder.
