**Last update:** 2025-11-15  
**Owner:** Compliance Office – Termination Stream  
**Scope:** `Drafts/09_Service_Termination_Plan_GR_EN.md`, `Final/09_Service_Termination_Plan_GR_EN.pdf`, `Evidence/ANNEX_E_Termination_Exercise_Evidence.md`, Doc 08/11/12 dependencies.

## 1. Completed Enhancements
| GAP ID | Requirement | Action Implemented | Evidence Location |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| GAP-09-01 | Missing alignment with EETT Art.7-8 | Added sections 5–6 detailing planned/unplanned termination steps + notifications | `Drafts/09_Service_Termination_Plan_GR_EN.md` §5-6 |
| GAP-09-02 | Continuity/hand-over controls absent | Documented archival custody, API access, escrow and QSCD custody (Sections 8–12) | Same as above |
| GAP-09-03 | No exercise proof | Annex E scenario summary + Evidence folder stub | `Evidence/ANNEX_E_Termination_Exercise_Evidence.md` |
| GAP-09-04 | Document control lacking | Section 20 doc-control table + PDF signature (pending validation) | Draft + Final artefacts |

## 2. Outstanding Actions
1. **PDF validation & hash (Critical)** – Review `Final/09_Service_Termination_Plan_GR_EN.pdf`, capture SHA-256 and QSeal proof, store data in `Evidence/Hashes_SHA256.txt`. Owner: Corporate Comms + QTS Manager.
2. **Custodian roster update (High)** – Populate Section 11 table with executed agreements list, cross-checked against Doc 12 records, then log ticket ID here. Owner: Compliance Ops.
3. **Exercise attachments (High)** – Upload signed attendance sheets/screenshots to Doc 12, reference IDs in `Evidence/ANNEX_E_Termination_Exercise_Evidence.md`. Owner: Corporate Resilience Lead.
4. **Cross-doc sync (Medium)** – Update references to Doc 08 notifications and Doc 12 recordkeeping once placeholders completed. Owner: Compliance Lead.
