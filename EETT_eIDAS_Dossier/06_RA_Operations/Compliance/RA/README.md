# RA Compliance Tracker (Placeholder)

Expected artefacts:
- `06_RA_Submission_Readiness.md`: mirror the structure used for Test Certificates (status icons, evidence refs).
- `RA_Audit_Log.md`: capture findings from CAB/EETT/internal QA when they review RA controls.
- KPI dashboards (e.g., SLA for identity verification, queue backlogs) used to support Doc 03 traceability rows.

Populate these items before generating Doc 02 §H attachments to avoid mismatched readiness signals.
