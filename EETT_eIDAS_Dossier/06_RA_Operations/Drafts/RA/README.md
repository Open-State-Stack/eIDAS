# RA Draft Workspace

Use this area for:
- Bilingual RA Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Identity proofing scripts (in-person, remote video, eID matching)
- Registrar onboarding checklists and forms
- Exception handling logs and escalation playbooks

Once SOPs are approved, export/sign them and store under `Final/RA/`. Evidence such as registrar attestations or queue screenshots should go to `Evidence/RA/`.
