# RA Evidence Placeholder

Upload supporting artefacts such as:
- Registrar training attestations (`Supporting_Docs/Personnel/Qualifications/RA_Operator_Training_Certificates.pdf` reference)
- Signed identity verification logs or ticket exports
- Remote identification session recordings (hash manifest)
- Exception handling reports and approvals

Reference each artefact inside Annex B and the overlap tracker so auditors can trace RA controls to tangible evidence.
