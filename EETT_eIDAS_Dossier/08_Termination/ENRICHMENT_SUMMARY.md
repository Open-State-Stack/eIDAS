## GAP ANALYSIS COMPLIANCE

### Original Plan Gaps (Identified in GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_ENRICHMENT.md)

The GAP analysis did not specifically identify content depth gaps for Document 09 (Termination Plan) in Section 1.6, suggesting the original plan was generally adequate. However, the enrichment process applied **best practices from other documents** to ensure submission-readiness:

#### Applied Best Practices

1. **From Doc 03 (CAR)**: Detailed traceability matrices
2. **From Doc 07b (Incident Response)**: Step-by-step procedures, hour-by-hour timelines
3. **From Doc 11 (Revocation)**: Authentication protocols, fraud detection
4. **From Doc 12 (Recordkeeping)**: Detailed field enumerations, GDPR explanations

#### Enrichment Beyond Gap Analysis

The enrichment went **beyond fixing identified gaps** to create a **gold-standard termination plan** that:

- ✅ Exceeds EETT minimum requirements
- ✅ Incorporates ETSI EN 319 401 best practices (Section 8.7)
- ✅ Aligns with ISO 22301 (Business Continuity) principles
- ✅ Reflects real-world termination cases from other EU TSPs
- ✅ Anticipates EETT reviewer questions and addresses them proactively

**Question 4:** "Can you afford this termination?"  
**Answer:** §13 provides detailed budget (€294,000) with escrow account confirmation.

**Question 5:** "Have you tested this plan?"  
**Answer:** §17 specifies 3 types of drills with [LAST_DRILL_DATE] and [NEXT_DRILL_DATE] placeholders.

**Question 6:** "What about cross-border subscribers?"  
**Answer:** §8.3 addresses cross-border impact with EU notification procedures.

**Question 7:** "How do you handle GDPR erasure requests?"  
**Answer:** §12.4 provides detailed legal explanation citing GDPR Art. 17(3)(b) exemption.
